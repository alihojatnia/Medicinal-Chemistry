## Medicinal-Chemistry
Medicinal chemistry is an interdisciplinary field that combines chemistry, pharmacology, and biological chemistry to design, synthesize, and develop new and innovative drugs to treat various diseases. It involves the study of chemical properties and interactions of drugs, their mechanisms of action, and the design of new drugs that are more effective and have fewer side effects. Medicinal chemists work closely with pharmacologists, toxicologists, and clinical researchers to understand the therapeutic targets and to design and synthesize compounds that can interact with these targets. The ultimate goal of medicinal chemistry is to discover and develop safe and effective drugs to improve human health. With the continuous advancements in technology and our understanding of human biology, the field of medicinal chemistry is constantly evolving and making a significant impact on modern medicine.

Cell surface receptors bind signaling molecules released by neurons and convert these signals into intracellular changes influencing the behavior of cells. Neurotransmitter is used here in its most general sense, including not only messengers that act to regulate ion channels but also those which act on second messenger systems and those which may act at a distance from their release sites. Included are receptors for neuromodulators, neuroregulators, neuromediators, and neurohumors, whether or not located at synapses.

"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence"
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, which can be used to teach pharmaceutical and chemistry students the basics of Deep Learning. No prior coding knowledge is required. These Notebooks are on their own not sufficient to properly convey the knowledge, instructors need to prepare accompanying lectures. These notebooks are also not designed to teach students to train neural networks without any aid. Rather they aim to teach about the workings of neural networks through code completion.
