# Medicinal-Chemistry
Medicinal chemistry is an interdisciplinary field that combines chemistry, pharmacology, and biological chemistry to design, synthesize, and develop new and innovative drugs to treat various diseases. It involves the study of chemical properties and interactions of drugs, their mechanisms of action, and the design of new drugs that are more effective and have fewer side effects. Medicinal chemists work closely with pharmacologists, toxicologists, and clinical researchers to understand the therapeutic targets and to design and synthesize compounds that can interact with these targets. The ultimate goal of medicinal chemistry is to discover and develop safe and effective drugs to improve human health. With the continuous advancements in technology and our understanding of human biology, the field of medicinal chemistry is constantly evolving and making a significant impact on modern medicine.
